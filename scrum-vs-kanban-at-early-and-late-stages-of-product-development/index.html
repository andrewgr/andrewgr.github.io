      <h1>Scrum vs Kanban at early and late stages of product development</h1>
      <p><small>2016-10-23</small></p>
      <p>I noticed that at the early stages of product development each agile dev team I've worked in used Scrum
        and gradually migrated to Kanban as the product matured. I don't think it was a coincidence. I actually
        think that by design Scrum works well during early stages, while Kanban may be a better choice
        for mature products.</p>

      <p>At the very beginning of the product life cycle the dev team needs to deliver a minimum viable product
        as soon as possible. Scrum defines a framework for a process that should help to achieve that. When a team
        follows Scrum prescriptions it works in short and very focused sprints, the stakeholders have clear
        expectations of the outcome of each sprint, and daily standups, planning, review and retro sessions give
        an opportunity to developers to share information, discuss priorities and scope, assess the progress, and
        find opportunities for improvement. In ideal world, if the product owner defines the right scope and sets
        the right priorities, every story shipped by the dev team brings the product closer to the releasable state.
        Also, Scrum recommends building cross-functional dev teams. Such teams are especially productive when working
        on the small codebase of a new product where each developer has a chance to work on every product component
        and there is little need for narrow specialisation.</p>

      <p>However, as the product matures after a few big post-MVP releases the development team becomes less busy
        with new development. At that stage devs spend more time on support, bug fixing, minor improvements, and
        paying out tech debt. As a result, it becomes increasingly harder to set a single well-defined goal for
        a sprint. Instead, a team may have two-three smaller goals. The idea of working in sprints may become less
        relevant as well. A lot of tasks at this stage have relatively low priority, unless they are major bugs,
        security issues or have hard deadlines, i.e. the end of financial year.</p>

      <p>In response to those changes the dev team has to adjust their development process. The devs change sprints
        duration. Eventually they stop using sprints to structure their work at all. Sprint planning and review
        sessions get replaced by less frequent roadmap planning and weekly backlog grooming sessions. The team
        typically still has retros, just maybe less often. Daily standup is the only meeting that is never removed
        from the calendar, though. In addition to that, the team finds it useful to limit the number of
        work-in-progress items on their board to make sure that every task is completed as quickly as possible
        and prioritises the tasks that are closer to &ldquo;done&rdquo; state over the &ldquo;not-started&rdquo; ones. This process looks more
        like Kanban and that makes sense because at this stage the goal for the team is normally to maintain the
        product and incrementally improve it, rather than ship a new release as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>I have seen that pattern a few times. Some of my fellow dev team leads confirmed they have observed that
        too, so I decided to share that experience.</p>
